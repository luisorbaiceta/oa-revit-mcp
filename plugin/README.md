# revit-mcp-plugin

English | [简体中文](README_zh.md)

## Introduction

revit-mcp-plugin is a Revit plugin based on the MCP protocol, enabling AI to interact with Revit.

This project is part of the revit-mcp project (receives messages, loads command sets, operates Revit), and needs to be used in conjunction with [revit-mcp](https://github.com/revit-mcp/revit-mcp) (provides tools to AI) and [revit-mcp-commandset](https://github.com/revit-mcp/revit-mcp-commandset) (specific feature implementations).

## Environment Requirements

- Revit 2019~2024

## Usage Instructions

### Register Plugin

Register the plugin and restart Revit:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<RevitAddIns>
  <AddIn Type="Application">
    <Name>revit-mcp</Name>
    <Assembly>%your_path%\revit-mcp-plugin.dll</Assembly>
    <FullClassName>revit_mcp_plugin.Core.Application</FullClassName>
    <ClientId>090A4C8C-61DC-426D-87DF-E4BAE0F80EC1</ClientId>
    <VendorId>revit-mcp</VendorId>
    <VendorDescription>https://github.com/revit-mcp/revit-mcp-plugin</VendorDescription>
  </AddIn>
</RevitAddIns>
```

`%your_path%` needs to be replaced with the actual path after compilation.

### Configure Commands

Add-in Modules -> Revit MCP Plugin -> Settings

This interface is used to configure the commands to be loaded into Revit. Click OpenCommandSetFolder to open the folder storing command sets. A typical command set folder structure looks like this:

```
CommandSetName/
├── 2019/                                # Compatible executable files for different versions
├── 2020/
├── 2021/
├── 2022/
├── 2023/
├── 2024/
└── command.json                         # Configuration file
```

Successfully identified commands need to be checked to be loaded and used.

### Enable Service

Add-in -> Revit MCP Plugin -> Revit MCP Switch

Open the service to allow AI to discover your Revit program. Now AI can control your Revit!

> Note: If you modify the configured commands after enabling the service, you may need to restart REVIT for the configuration to take effect. This is related to whether the command has already been registered.

## Custom Commands

You can refer to the [revit-mcp-commandset](https://github.com/revit-mcp/revit-mcp-commandset) project to develop custom commands.
